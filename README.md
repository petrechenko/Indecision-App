# Indecision-App

My first application made in React. This app will make a decision for you and save it for you as soon as it's running. So far it's running only on local host. 

I created a separate componant for each section of this page for the best practice of React.

## To start the application:
1. Make sure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable) installed on your computer
2. Run the command to set up the npm packages : `npm i`
3. Start the application with the coomand: `yarn dev-server` . It will give you the link to localhost, on ,y computer it is "http://localhost:8080/"
